# Some TODOs

- split int activities so that on smaller screens the live preview can be hidden
- loading from a URL (e.g. GitHub)
- loading and saving in file system with a name provided by the user
- fire it for .md / .markdown files (actually loading for .md works if they are somehow mimeType=application/octet-stream
- Add settings activity/page with colour choices for EditText
- Add ability to load other CSS
- Enable saving and loading of files
- Enable exporting HTML
- Get the scrollbar to display for EditText
- New icon for app (now that it's becoming more complete)
